# The Student Assessment Database (SAD)

The New York City Department of Education has a lot of archaic systems for collecting student data. Many of those systems don't speak to each other. The Student Assessment Database churns through STARS and ARIS-generated CSV files and makes sense of them.

In addition, it supports anecdotal notes, grade breakdowns, generates probation and honor roll lists and much more. It's based on [Padrino][] and is written in [Ruby][]. Users can authenticate using their Google account.

**Disclaimer**: SAD was built for the specific needs of the Scholars' Academy. You will probably want to tweak it a bit to fit your needs.
